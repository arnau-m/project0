Hello world!
My name is Arnau and I'm starting to learn web developing with the course cs50w from Harvard.
This is my first webpage, I've decided to do it about snowboarding because it's one of my favourit sports.

I used HTML and CSS for the main project, and just a little bit of CSCC. In my web there are 4 different HTML pages and you can go through any one of them using a breadcrumb, which really helps the user to interact between pages.

YOU CAN CHECK THE CODE HERE->
YOU CAN CHECK THE WEBPAGE HERE->

It has been a really good experience and now it's time to continue with the course:)
