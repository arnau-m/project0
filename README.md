Hello world!

My name is Arnau and I'm starting to learn web developing with the course cs50w from Harvard.
This is my first webpage, I've decided to do it about snowboarding because it's one of my favourit sports.

I used HTML and CSS for the main project. In my web there are 4 different HTML pages and you can go through any one of them using a breadcrumb, which really helps the user to interact between pages.

Boards page shows a snowboard gallery and a little bit of information about them.
Resorts page shows some of the best resorts worldwide and information about them.
Riders resorts is a list with some of the best riders and how many X-Games did they win.

I add some animatoins and Bootstrap desings to make the web cooler.

The hole webpage is mobile response thanks to @media comands.

It has been a really good experience and now it's time to continue with the course:)
